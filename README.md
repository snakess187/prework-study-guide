# prework-study-guide

## A study guide for course pre-work


This project was created for studying purposes to act as a guide in web development. It helps organize the users expected objectives for the class and sheds some light on the type of work they will be doing. 

HTML: We learned how to use HTML to create the structure and content of a website, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

CSS: We learned how to use CSS to style a website, including changing the color and font of the text, adding borders and images. 

JavaScript: We learned how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to a website, for loops and if else if statments. 


The Prework Study Guide is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn about web development. It covers a variety of topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section contains  brief notes about the topic. By opening the DevTools console, we can even see the JavaScript code in action
